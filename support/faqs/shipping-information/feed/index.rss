<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://gotrax.com/">GOTRAX</a> team is just as excited to see new Commanders jet around as you are! That&rsquo;s why we try to get all our Commander&rsquo;s e-rideables delivered quickly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your GOTRAX spacecraft is shipped, you can expect it to arrive within about five business days. We&rsquo;ll also provide you with a tracking number so you can see its progress as our space couriers ship it from our Command Center, across the GOTRAX GALAXY, to your home base. </span></p>
